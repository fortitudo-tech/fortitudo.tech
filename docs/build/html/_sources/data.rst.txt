The P&L simulation from :cite:t:`SeqEntropyPooling` follows with this package
and assumes that returns follow a log-normal distribution with parameters
given by `the Danish common return expectations for the 2nd half of 2021
<https://www.afkastforventninger.dk/en/common-return-expectations/>`_.

The simulation is used in all examples and allows you to immediately start 
exploring the functionality of this package. You can also use it to test your
understanding of the theory as well as replicate results.
