Examples
========

Jupyter Notebook examples are available in the `fortitudo.tech GitHub repository
<https://github.com/fortitudo-tech/fortitudo.tech/tree/main/examples>`_.
The repository contains the following examples:

1) How to combine Entropy Pooling views / stress-tests with CVaR optimization
2) A replication of the results from :cite:t:`SeqEntropyPooling` for the original
   Entropy Pooling method
3) A comparison between mean-CVaR and mean-variance optimization illustrating why
   we use demeaned CVaR as default

The parameters and simulation used in the examples are based on :cite:t:`SeqEntropyPooling`.
