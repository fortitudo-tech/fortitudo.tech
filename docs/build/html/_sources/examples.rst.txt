Examples
========

Jupyter Notebook examples are available in `fortitudo.tech GitHub repository
<https://github.com/fortitudo-tech/fortitudo.tech/tree/main/examples>`_.
The repository contains two examples:

1) How to combine Entropy Pooling views / stress-tests with CVaR optimization
2) A replication of the results from :cite:t:`SeqEntropyPooling` for the original
   Entropy Pooling method

The data used in all of the examples is the simulation from :cite:t:`SeqEntropyPooling`.
