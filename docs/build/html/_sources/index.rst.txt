Fortitudo Technologies Open Source
==================================

This package allows you to explore open-source implementations of some of our
fundamental methods, for example, Sequential Entropy Pooling (SeqEP), CVaR optimization,
and Fully Flexible Resampling (FFR) in Python.

You can watch this `YouTube playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfI2BKNVj_b2rurUsCtc2F8lqtPWqcs2K>`_
for a walkthrough of the package's functionality and examples.

For a high-level introduction to the investment framework, watch this `YouTube video <https://youtu.be/4ESigySdGf8>`_
and `Substack post <https://open.substack.com/pub/antonvorobets/p/entropy-pooling-and-cvar-portfolio-optimization-in-python-ffed736a8347>`_.

For a pedagogical and deep presentation of the investment framework and its methods,
see the `Portfolio Construction and Risk Management Book <https://antonvorobets.substack.com/p/pcrm-book>`_.

To build the deepest understanding of all the theories and methods, you can
complete the `Applied Quantitative Investment Management Course <https://antonvorobets.substack.com/t/course>`_.

Audience
--------

The package is intended for advanced users who are comfortable specifying
portfolio constraints and Entropy Pooling views using matrices and vectors.
This gives full flexibility in relation to working with these technologies.
Hence, input checking is intentionally kept to a minimum.

Company
-------

Fortitudo Technologies offers novel investment software as well as quantitative
and digitalization consultancy to the investment management industry. For more
information, please visit our `website <https://fortitudo.tech>`_.

Disclaimer
----------

This package is completely separate from our proprietary solutions and therefore
not representative of the quality and functionality offered by the `Investment Simulation
and Investment Analysis modules <https://fortitudo.tech/solutions>`_.

For a short comparison of which CVaR problems the Investment Analysis module can solve
and at what speed, see the
`cvar-optimization-benchmarks repository <https://github.com/fortitudo-tech/cvar-optimization-benchmarks>`_.

If you are an institutional investor and want to experience how these methods
can be used for sophisticated analysis in practice, please request a demo by
sending an email to demo@fortitudo.tech.

Code of Conduct
---------------

We welcome feedback and bug reports, but we have very limited resources for
support and feature requests. If you experience bugs with some of the upstream
packages, please report them directly to the maintainers of the upstream packages.
