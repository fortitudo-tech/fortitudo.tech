Fortitudo Technologies Open Source
==================================

This package allows you to freely explore open-source implementations of some
of our fundamental technologies, e.g., Entropy Pooling and CVaR optimization 
in Python.

The package is intended for advanced users who are comfortable specifying
portfolio constraints and Entropy Pooling views using matrices and vectors.
This gives full flexibility in relation to working with these technologies
and allows you to build your own high-level interfaces if you wish. Hence,
input checking is intentionally kept to a minimum.

Fortitudo Technologies is a fintech company that offers novel investment
technologies as well as quantitative and digitalization consultancy to the
investment management industry. For more information, please visit our
`website <https://fortitudo.tech>`_.

Disclaimer
----------

This package is completely separate from our proprietary solutions and therefore
not representative of neither the quality nor the functionality offered by the Simulation
Engine and Investment Analysis modules. If you are an institutional investor and want
to experience how some of these methods can be used in practice for sophisticated
investment analysis, please request a demo by sending an email to demo@fortitudo.tech.

Code of Conduct
---------------

We welcome feedback and bug reports, but we have very limited resources for
support and feature requests. If you experience bugs with some of the upstream
packages, please report them directly to the maintainers of the upstream packages.
