Fortitudo Technologies Open Source
==================================

This package allows you to explore open-source implementations of some of our
fundamental technologies, e.g., Entropy Pooling and CVaR optimization in Python.

The package is intended for advanced users who are comfortable specifying
portfolio constraints and Entropy Pooling views using matrices and vectors.
This gives full flexibility in relation to working with these technologies.
Hence, input checking is intentionally kept to a minimum.

Fortitudo Technologies offers novel investment software as well as quantitative and
digitalization consultancy to the investment management industry. For more information,
please visit our `website <https://fortitudo.tech>`_.

Disclaimer
----------

This package is completely separate from our proprietary solutions and therefore
not representative of neither the quality nor the functionality offered by the Simulation
Engine and Investment Analysis modules. If you are an institutional investor who wants
to experience how these methods can be used for sophisticated analysis in practice,
please request a demo by sending an email to demo@fortitudo.tech.

Code of Conduct
---------------

We welcome feedback and bug reports, but we have very limited resources for
support and feature requests. If you experience bugs with some of the upstream
packages, please report them directly to the maintainers of the upstream packages.
