Documentation
-------------

The left sidebar contains links to the documentation of the main modules of
this package as well as two examples:

1) How to combine Entropy Pooling views / stress-tests with CVaR optimization,
2) A replication of the results from :cite:t:`SeqEntropyPooling` for the original
   Entropy Pooling method.

The data used in all of the example is the simulation from :cite:t:`SeqEntropyPooling`.
