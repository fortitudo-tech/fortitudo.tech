Examples
========

Jupyter Notebook examples are available in the `fortitudo.tech GitHub repository
<https://github.com/fortitudo-tech/fortitudo.tech/tree/main/examples>`_.
The repository contains the following examples:

1) How to combine CVaR optimization with Entropy Pooling views / stress-tests
2) A replication of the results from :cite:t:`Vorobets2021` for the original
   Entropy Pooling method
3) The accompanied code for :cite:t:`Vorobets2022` with a comparison of
   mean-CVaR and mean-variance optimization explaining why we use demeaned
   CVaR as default
4) An illustration of how to work with the time series simulation that follows
   with this package
5) The accompanied code for :cite:t:`Vorobets2022a` with an example of how to
   use the relative market values :math:`v` parameter for portfolio optimization
6) How to use the simulation / P&L modeling functionality with historical time
   series for FAANG stocks

The examples are good places to start exploring the functionality of this package.
We have very limited resources for support in relation to these, but please let
us know if you have suggestions for how we can improve them and make them easier
to understand.
