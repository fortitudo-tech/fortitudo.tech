Fortitudo Technologies Open Source
==================================

This package allows you to explore open-source implementations of some of our
fundamental technologies, e.g., Entropy Pooling and CVaR optimization in Python.
For a high-level introduction, see this `YouTube video <https://youtu.be/FOiY8aRVC90>`_
and `Medium article <https://medium.com/@ft_anvo/entropy-pooling-and-cvar-portfolio-optimization-in-python-ffed736a8347>`_.

The package is intended for advanced users who are comfortable specifying
portfolio constraints and Entropy Pooling views using matrices and vectors.
This gives full flexibility in relation to working with these technologies.
Hence, input checking is intentionally kept to a minimum.

If you like this package, we invite you to show your support by giving it a
GitHub star. The greater the number of stars it receives, the more time and
energy we will invest in enhancing its functionality and providing additional
examples.

Fortitudo Technologies offers novel investment software as well as quantitative
and digitalization consultancy to the investment management industry. For more

Disclaimer
----------

This package is completely separate from our proprietary solutions and therefore
not representative of the quality and functionality offered by the Investment Simulation
and Investment Analysis modules. If you are an institutional investor who wants to
experience how these methods can be used for sophisticated analysis in practice,
please request a demo by sending an email to demo@fortitudo.tech.

Code of Conduct
---------------

We welcome feedback and bug reports, but we have very limited resources for
support and feature requests. If you experience bugs with some of the upstream
packages, please report them directly to the maintainers of the upstream packages.
