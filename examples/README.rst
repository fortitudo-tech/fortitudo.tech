Examples
========

The examples are good places to start exploring the functionality of this package.
We have very limited resources for support in relation to these, but please let
us know if you have suggestions for how we can improve them and make them easier
to understand.

You can explore the examples in the cloud without any local installations using
`Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fortitudo-tech/fortitudo.tech/main?labpath=examples>`_.
However, note that Binder servers have very limited ressources and might not support
some of the optimized routines this package uses. For best performance, you should
install the package on a machine that supports the `Math Kernel Library <https://en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_Kernel_Library>`_.
