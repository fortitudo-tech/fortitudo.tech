Examples
========

See this `YouTube playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfI2BKNVj_b2rurUsCtc2F8lqtPWqcs2K>`_
for a walkthrough of the package's functionality and examples. The examples are
good places to start exploring the functionality of this package. We have very
limited resources for support in relation to these, but please let us know if you
have suggestions for how we can improve them and make them easier to understand.

You can explore the examples in the cloud without any local installations using
`Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fortitudo-tech/fortitudo.tech/main?labpath=examples>`_.
However, note that Binder servers have very limited resources and might not support
some of the optimized routines this package uses. If you want access to a stable
and optimized environment with persistent storage, please subscribe to our Data
Science Server.
